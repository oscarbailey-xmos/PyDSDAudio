#### building from source RPM
If needed, first setup your system for RPM building, see [Fedora, building a custom kernel] (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Building_a_custom_kernel)

Install the source RPM:

`rpm -ivh SRPMS/python-alsaaudio-0.7-11.fc25.src.rpm`

`cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS`

`rpmbuild -bb --target=$(uname -m) python-alsaaudio.spec`

Install the newly created RPM:

``dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/`uname -m`/python-alsaaudio-0.7-11.fc25.`uname -m`.rpm``
